# Landing Page
### _Utilizing JavaScript to make dynamic experience_

The Landing Page Project is an example of how to harness the power of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by the following:

- Creating new elements just like the top menu and its styles.
- Editing styles and functionality for activated and deactivated elements.
- Automatic scrolling on-click.

## Features

- A Dynamically created navigation menu on the header, and no matter how many sections will be added in `index.html` the menu will adapt to it in automatic fashion.
- The page automatically scrolls to the desired section when you click on its peer on the navigation menu.
- The activated section and its peer on the navigation menu change their styles in order to exhibit their active status.
- The previous activated section and its peer return to their native style.

## Tech

- The original `index.html` and `css/styles.css` are provided by [Udacity].
- The original `index.html` provided by [Udacity] has 3 sections and 2 other sections were added to test the functionality of adding new navigation menu items automatically.
- All other development features -including CSS new rules- are done in `js/app.js`.
- Developed by [Diaa Hassouna] - a JavaScript Project Submission.
